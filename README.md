ðŸŽ‰ Thrilled to announce my latest project! ðŸŽ‰

I've just completed a fun and interactive Quiz Game using C++! This game presents multiple-choice questions to users, tracks their scores, and provides instant feedback on their answers. Key features include:

âœ… Dynamic multiple-choice question presentation âœ… Real-time score tracking âœ… Immediate feedback on answers âœ… User-friendly and engaging interface

This project has been a fantastic way to apply my C++ skills and explore game development. It's been both challenging and rewarding to bring this idea to life.
